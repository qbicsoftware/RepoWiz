## Description

The **__Fair Data Principle__** demands the submission of data of funded research in order to make it publicly accessible. 
Since there are a lot of repositories for different data types or even multiple repositories for the same data types but with different requirements for the submission, 
in order to facilitate FAIR data RepoWiz supports the upload from any local management systems to different repositories.

## How to Install
In order to execute the code you need to clone the repository

```git clone https://github.com/qbicsoftware/RepoWiz```

and then package the jar with Maven

```mvn clean package```

## Run

RepoWiz offers different subcommands for different users


#### Guide
For inexperienced users RepoWiz offers a __guide__ that suggest a suitable repository for your project
